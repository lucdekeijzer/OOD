This repository is meant as a starting point for Out-of-Distribution research.
It contains code to perform inferences, training networks and visualization of results in plots. The code contains two different working detectors, those being the Multi-layer Mahalanobis detector and the Max-Softmax detector. It is based on the pytorch-ood package in python.

The current version of this code is in a Jupyter notebook and the different functions are in different code cells. This was done to make sure it can be run on any machine, no matter the GPU, through Google Colab.
